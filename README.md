# COVID19 Jupyter Notebook

A personal notebook I created for tracking/predicting COVID19 numbers.

**I'm not a data scientist**, just created this out of personal interest and to learn about the existing tools out there.

> **IMPORTANT**: These predictions are wrong and shouldn't be taken seriously!

If you're a data scientist or have knowledge in this area, feel free to clone it
and modify it as you wish. And let me know about your findings.
